# CSPB-1300-Arrays-and-Vectors
Accessing the description of homework for CSPB-1300

This repository is a set of documents to be read before beginning your C++ homework on Arrays and Vectors. 
The assignment is based on the chapters in the Big C++ book that have been assigned for this week. 
 
##IMPORTANT NOTES THIS WEEK:
Some of the features this week may require you to compile using the C++11 standard. From now on, you should compile your code using this standard. To compile your code using the C++11 standard, add the standard flag to your g++ command:
    
    g++ -std=c++11 -o executable_filename cpp_filename.cpp
    
This week the majority of the homework problems ask you to write a function. 
This is in contrast to the previous weeks where you entered the entire C++ program in the answer box. 
For the problems that ask you to write a function and not a program, please remember to only include the relevant function or functions and **DO NOT include the main function in your solution**. 
You are allowed to include as many helper functions in addition to the required function as you'd like. 
Also, the function prototype is given for each problem so you know exactly the required function name, return type, and required parameters. 

Please read the instruction page in the repository for more details on the functions required by the assignment.
